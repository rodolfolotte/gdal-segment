# extension of gdal-segment

 * **GDAL Segment** implements various segmentation algorithms over raster images. It can
be used to segment large aerial, satellite imagery of various formats supported by GDAL and
various layouts like multispectral or hyperspectral. It uses OpenCV for it's core algorithms,
and GDAL for undelying I/O. Implementation here follows several multithread and memory
friendly optimizations, thus very large scenes are supported well.

 * At this moment it implements LSC, SLIC, SLICO and SEEDS.

```
Usage: gdal-segment [-help] src_raster1 src_raster2 .. src_rasterN -out dst_vector
    [-of <output_format> 'ESRI Shapefile' is default]
    [-b R B (N-th band from R-th raster)] [-algo <LSC, SLICO, SLIC, SEEDS>]
    [-niter <1..500>] [-region <pixels>]
    [-blur (apply 3x3 gaussian blur)]

Default niter: 10 iterations
```
